            "description": "Steve Hackett, as the powerhouse guitarist for one of the most important progressive rock bands ever, has been a guiding influence for musicians and guitarists for over 40 years.    Following the one/two punch of “Nursery Cryme” & “Foxtrot”, both driven by the muscular guitars of new member Steve Hackett, Genesis were ready to launch what would become their finest album, “Selling England By The Pound”.    Easing back on the throttle marginally, and immersing themselves in English whimsy and eccentricity, Genesis delivered just under an hour of delicate prose, wondrous melodies and, of course, the soaring leadlines of Steve Hackett.    Finally, now, 47 years after the album’s release, Steve Hackett will be performing “Selling England By The Pound” in full in a series of Australian and New Zealand concerts.    “I think (Genesis) really nailed the best of what that band as an entity could have done with that album.” Neil Peart (Rush)    \"… a complexity of tone that's pretty rare in any kind of art.\" Robert Christgau    “the definitive Genesis album” Fish (formerly of Marillion)    In addition, in celebration of the 40th anniversary of its release, Steve will be performing his critically acclaimed solo album “Spectral Mornings”.    “Spectral Mornings is a superb disc from one of the genre's all-time greatest guitarists. Five stars!” Prog archives    And if that’s not enough, Steve will perform selections from his stunning new album “At The Edge Of Light”, and may even be munificent enough to throw in another couple of Genesis tunes.    “I’m excited to bring my Genesis Revisited show back to Australia and New Zealand. It was fantastic to play there last time and to visit those amazing countries. This time will be a special show, including the whole of Genesis album Selling England by the Pound, celebrating my solo album Spectral Mornings 40th anniversary, plus more! I can’t wait!” Steve Hackett",

            "description": "Support: Introvert    Canadian pop-rockers MARIANAS TRENCH will make a very welcome return to Australia’s east coast for a trio of explosive shows in April 2020 in support of their latest album release and iTunes Pop chart #1, Phantoms.    Completing epic treks across North America, UK and Europe, the Suspending Gravity Tour will touch down in Sydney’s Metro Theatre on April 5, ahead of performances at Download UK in June.    VIP Packages are also available including access to a special Q&A session and Meet & Greet with the band.    Hitting #1 on iTunes Pop chart here and in the USA, as well as their native Canada, Phantoms is Marianas Trench’s fifth studio album following their 2006 debut Fix Me, Masterpiece Theatre (2009), Ever After (2011) and Astoria (2015).    Marianas Trench draw on well-established strengths – their trademark, heavily layered harmonies, as well as blazing guitars set against club-worthy beats - but Phantoms also finds the Vancouver-based four-piece pushing their musical boundaries relentlessly. From the jaw-dropping opener, ‘Eleonora’ – a heavily layered a cappella salute to Edgar Allan Poe’s 1842 short story of the same name – to the unapologetically epic closer, ‘The Killing Kind’, with its deep orchestration, ripping guitars and vocal gymnastics.    “Each time we do an album, I try and write something that’s out of my vocal reach that forces me to get better,” says founding member and frontman Josh Ramsay, adding that bassist Mike Ayley, guitarist Matt Webb and drummer Ian Casselman, his “three favourite collaborators,” are equally dedicated to pushing their limits vocally and instrumentally - making for a dynamic live show.
